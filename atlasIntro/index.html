          <h4>The Large Hadron Collider</h4>
          <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a series of tubes, but rather different from other well-known series of tubes such as sewers and the internet.  It is a feat of engineering due to its massive scale, strong magnetic fields, and huge amounts of superconducting material that is kept cold by liquid helium.</p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="lhcTunnel.jpg" class="center-block img-responsive" width="70%">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">The LHC.  Not the home of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>The LHC is 27km in circumference and accelerates protons to <i>very</i> high speeds and energies.  Protons are made to collide at eight points around the ring, one of which is in the center of the ATLAS detector.</p>

          <h4>The ATLAS detector</h4>

          <p>The ATLAS detector - or simply <i>ATLAS</i> - is massive, but not nearly as massive as the LHC.  It takes up roughly the space of a cylinder that is 50m long and 25m in diameter (24,500 m<sup>3</sup>).  It is densly filled with electronics.</p>

          <p>ATLAS is composed of subdetector systems.  The three primary detector systems are arranged in concentric layers - like that of an onion.  The innermost system is the Inner Detector, followed by the Calorimeter, and finally the Muon Spectrometer (MS).</p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="atlasLayers.jpg" class="center-block img-responsive" width="70%">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">A cartoon of a slice of the ATLAS detector.  The protons collide in the center of ATLAS, which is the bottom of the figure, creating various particles that travel outwards.  The innermost detector layer is called the Inner Detector.  The Inner Detector measures the path that electrically charged particles travel.  The middle layer is the calorimeter.  The calorimeters are very dense, and most particles interact with the calorimeters causing "jets" of particles.  The calorimeter measures the energy of the jet showers.  Some particles, such as muons and neutrinos, are not stopped by the calorimeter.  The outermost layer is the Muon Spectrometer.  It measures the path of muons.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>When protons are collided in the center of ATLAS, new particles are created that travel outwards from the collision point.  The Inner Detector, Calorimeter, and Muon Spectrometer are designed to measure these particles with the assumption that the particles originate from the proton collision point.  This is generally a safe assumption for the particles of the Standard Model, which comprises the physics that we already know about.</p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="particleDetectorInteractions.gif" class="center-block img-responsive" width="70%">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">This figure shows effectively what's seen by the detector in each layer.  The Inner Detector (tracking chamber) observes the path of electrically charged particles through it.  The calorimeter layers interact with most particles, causing complicated jets that typcially don't escape the calorimeter.  The Muon Spectrometer measures the path of muons, the only electrically charged particle that escapes the Calorimeter.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>What happens if there's new particles to be discovered, and new physics theories that describe these particles?  The design of the ATLAS detector isn't optimized for detecting all new particle signatures.  Here are two proton collision events that have been simulated by ATLAS software.  These events contain exotic particles that travel invisibly for some distance before becoming (via decay) the regular particles of the Standard Model.  (Exotic particles simply means new particles that do not belong to the standard model).</p>
