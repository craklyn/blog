          <h4>The Large Hadron Collider</h4>
          <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a series of tubes, but rather different from other well-known series of tubes such as sewers and the internet.  It is a feat of engineering due to its massive scale, strong magnetic fields, and huge amounts of superconducting material that is kept cold by liquid helium.</p>

          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>The LHC is 27km in circumference and accelerates protons to very high speeds and energies.  Protons are made to collide at eight points around the ring, one of which is in the center of the ATLAS experiment.</p>

          <h4>The ATLAS detector</h4>

          <p>The ATLAS detector - or simply <emph>ATLAS</emph> - is massive, but not nearly as massive as the LHC.  It takes up roughly the space of a cylinder that is 50m long and 25m in diameter (24,500 m<sup>3</sup>).  It is densly filled with electronics.</p>

          <p>ATLAS is composed of subdetector systems.  The three primary detector systems are arranged in concentric layers - like that of an onion.  The innermost system is the Inner Detector, followed by the Calorimeter, and finally the Muon Spectrometer (MS).</p>

          <p>When protons are collided in the center of ATLAS, new particles are created that travel outwards from the collision point.  The Inner Detector, Calorimeter, and Muon Spectrometer are designed to measure these particles with the assumption that the particles originate from the proton collision point.  This is generally a safe assumption for the particles of the Standard Model, which comprises the physics that we already know about.</p>

          <p>What happens if there's new particles to be discovered, and new physics theories that describe these particles?  The design of the ATLAS detector isn't optimized for detecting all new particle signatures.  Here are two proton collision events that have been simulated by ATLAS software.  These events contain exotic particles that travel invisibly for some distance before becoming (via decay) the regular particles of the Standard Model.  (Exotic particles simply means new particles that do not belong to the standard model).</p>
