        <h1>ATLAS Triggers</h1>
        <p class="lead">ATLAS collects a lot of data.  A really big lot. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a lot of data stored on a Snoop Dogg compact disc, but that's just peanuts to ATLAS.</p>

          <h4>Atlas Triggering</h4>
          <p>Interesting physics events are incredibly rare.  If I want to observe the Higgs boson, I expect that I need 10 billion proton collisions at the LHC (that's 10<sup>10</sup> collisions!) to produce a single Higgs boson.  In other words, exciting new physics is very rare.  In order to find such rare events, the LHC must collide protons very frequently.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">A collision of two protons, as detected in the ATLAS experiment and displayed in a computer-generated visual representation.  Here, a Higgs particle may have been created, which subsequently decayed to two muons and two anti-muons (red lines).  Events like this which may be evidence of new physics occuring are very rare in particle detectors.  This figure was originally shown in Fabiola Gianotti’s July 4th presentation announcing ATLAS’s discovery of a Higgs-like particle.</figcaption>

          <br>

          <p>In 2011 and 2012, the LHC provided proton collisions every 50 nanoseconds, or 20 million collisions per second.  Each event uses about 1.6 MB of disk space to store.  This would present an impossible data challenge if all collision events were stored.  Instead, only a small fraction are kept.</p>

          <p>Triggers are hardware and software that run in ATLAS to filter the most interesting events that should be permanently stored.  The other events, the vast majority, are not stored to disk and are permanently forgotten.</p>

          <img src="FilterDiagram.svg" class="center-block img-responsive" width="50%">
          <p>What do triggers look for?  They look for signatures of elementary particles such as electrons, muons, taus, and photons.  They look for clusters of particles in a small space that collectively have significant energy, called jets.  They look for jets  on one side of the detector with a lack of particles recoiling toward the opposite side, called missing energy.  When the triggers see these signatures and the signatures are of sufficiently high energy, the event is stored permanently for further physics analysis.</p>
          <p>Now, what happens if there is new physics out there that differs vastly from what these triggers look for?  In that case, these new physics events would never be stored, nobody would ever see them, and no discovery could ever be made.  And this is where my research begins...</p>

          <h4>Triggers for Displaced Decays</h4>
          <p>If there are new particles out there, they might be different from any physics we've seen before.  The particle and jet triggers may not select exotic physics signatures.</p>

          <p>Reiterating what was said before: Events that aren't selected by triggers, they are lost forever.  It is imperative to create triggers that can find new physics.</p>
