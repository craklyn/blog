        <h1>ATLAS Triggers</h1>
        <p class="lead">ATLAS collects a lot of data.  A really big lot. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a lot of data stored on a Snoop Dogg compact disc, but that's just peanuts to ATLAS.</p>

          <h4>Atlas Triggering</h4>
          <p>Interesting physics events are incredibly rare.  If I want to observe the Higgs boson, I expect that I need 10 billion proton collisions at the LHC (that's 10<sup>10</sup> collisions!) to produce a single Higgs boson.  In order to find such rare events, the LHC must collide protons very frequently.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">A collision of two protons that was observed with the ATLAS detector and is being displayed in a computer-generated visual representation.  Here, a Higgs particle may have been created, which subsequently decayed to two muons and two anti-muons (red lines).  Events like this which may be evidence of new physics occuring are very rare in particle detectors.  This figure made its debut in Fabiola Gianotti’s July 4th presentation announcing ATLAS’s discovery of a Higgs-like particle.</figcaption>

          <br>

          <p>In 2011 and 2012, the LHC provided proton collisions every 50 nanoseconds, or 20 million collisions per second.  Each event uses about 1.6 MB of disk space to store.  This would present an impossible data challenge if all collision events were stored.  Instead, only a small fraction are kept.</p>

          <p>Triggers are the hardware and software in ATLAS that select the most interesting events that should be permanently stored.  The other events, the vast majority, are not stored to disk - permanently forgotten.</p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="pastaFiltering.jpg" class="center-block img-responsive" width="50%">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">Triggers are a type of data filter.  They seperate interesting physics events from background like pasta is separated from the water it is cooked in.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>What do triggers look for?  They look for signatures of elementary particles such as electrons, muons, taus, and photons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>  <i>Jets</i>:  Clusters of particles traveling in the same direction leaving significant energy in the Calorimeter.</li>
            <li>  <i>Missing Momentum</i>: The law of conservation of momentum tells us that if there are particle jets in one direction of the detector, they must have recoiled of of other particles travelling the other way.  If we don't see a balance in momentum, we say there is momentum missing.</li>
            <li>  Muons: Muons are identified with the Muon Detector and the Inner Detector. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Now, what happens if there is new physics out there that differs vastly from what these triggers look for?  In that case, these new physics events would never be stored, nobody would ever see them, and no discovery could ever be made.  And this is where my research begins...</p>

          <h4>Triggers for Displaced Decays</h4>
          <p>If there are new particles out there, they might be different from any physics we've seen before.  The particle and jet triggers may not select exotic physics signatures.</p>

          <p>Consider the neutral, long-lived particle signatures that I discussed in Part 1.  If these particles travel to the outermost subdetector, the Muon Detector, and decay, they will not create jets and their showers will be far too noisy to consistently give a muon signature.  Missing energy might be present, but it can be too small of an amount to be selected by a trigger.</p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">A full simulation of an event with two neutral, long-lived particles decaying in the ATLAS detector.  The event is displayed in a computer-generated visual representation.  One long-lived particle decays in the calorimeter (near B) and leaves significant energy deposits there.  The second long-lived particle decays in the Muon Detector (near C) and leaves many detector hits (magenta lines and cyan points).</figcaption>

          <p>We want to make sure that this sort of event is available for us to discover, so we need to define a new trigger that can select these events.  To identify a neutral long-lived particle signature, we need to create a new, specialized trigger.  Because computation time is severely limited, we want to assemble the trigger out of data objects that are already being processed.  One such object is called the Level-1 Muon Trigger, which I will abbreviate L1Mu.</p>

          <p>The L1MU trigger is a simple data object that is made when two hits happen in coincidence in the Muon Detector.  The figure below illustrates the L1MU trigger more clearly.  We use this trigger because many L1MU's are present when a neutral, long-lived particle decays in the Muon Detector.
