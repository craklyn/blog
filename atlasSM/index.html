          <h4>The Standard Model</h4>

          <p>Scientists' job is to understand and describe the world around us.  Such an explanation is simply called a <i>Theory</i>.  A theory that is limited in scope is an effective theory.  The Standard Model is the effective theory of high energy particle physics.  It correctly accounts for all measurements made in particle colliders to date, and describes all of the known particles.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">The particles of the Standard Model.  The Standard Model is a framework for understanding all observations made in particle accelerators to date.  Our everyday experience is made up of up- and down-quarks (which are combined to make protons and neutrons), electrons, and photons.</figure>
          <br>

          <p>So the Standard Model accurately describes all observations made by colliders to date.  Why do I add the caveat that it's only an effective theory?  The answer is because we know there is more physics out there, waiting to be discovered.  Astronomers have observed that there is other matter in the univesre causing strong gravitation within and between galaxies.  This matter is not observed directly, so it is referred to as <i>dark matter</i>.  Presumably, dark matter is made up of new particles that have not been discovered yet.  There are also some theoretical problems with the Standard Model, such as the ominously-named <i>hierarchy problem</i>.

          <h4>Exotic Physics</h4>

          <p>What happens if there's new particles to be discovered, and new physics theories that describe these particles?  The design of the ATLAS detector isn't optimized for detecting all new particle signatures.  Here are two proton collision events that have been simulated by ATLAS software.  These events contain exotic particles that travel invisibly for some distance before becoming (via decay) the regular particles of the Standard Model.  (Exotic particles simply means new particles that do not belong to the standard model).</p>
