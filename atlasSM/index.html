          <h4>Foreword</h4>
          <p>This is the first in a series of posts that describes my PhD research.  Although my research has been published and written up in my thesis, it is not digestable to the non-expert.  In these posts, I will try to present it in a simple way.  When the details are too cumbersome, I may describe the research imprecisely - but hopefully without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

          <h4>The Standard Model</h4>

          <p>Scientists' job is to understand and describe the world around us.  Such an explanation is simply called a <i>Theory</i>.  A theory that is limited in scope is an <i>effective theory</i>.  The Standard Model is the effective theory of high energy particle physics.  It correctly accounts for all observations made in particle colliders to date, and describes all of the known particles.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption" align="center">The particles of the Standard Model.  Our everyday experience is made up of up- and down-quarks (which combine to make protons and neutrons), electrons, and photons (electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light).</figure>
          <br>

          <p>So the Standard Model accurately describes all observations made by colliders to date.  Why do I add the caveat that it's only an effective theory?  Answer: We know there is more physics out there, waiting to be discovered!</p>

          <p>How do we know there's more physics to be discovered?  Here are some clues:
          <ul> 
            <li>Dark matter: Astronomers have observed strong gravitation attraction within and between galaxies - more than is accounted for by the stars and planets.  Whatever matter is causing this gravitational attraction isn't visible, so we call it dark matter.  Presumably this matter is made up of new particles that have not yet been discovered.</li>
            <li>The Hierarchy Problem: This is a theoretical problem having to do with the mass of the Higgs boson.  There are ways to calculate "small corrections" to the Higgs Boson's mass.  These corrections are 10<exp>18</exp> GeV - astronomically larger than the actual, measured mass of the Higgs boson of 125 GeV.  The only conceivable reason for the Higgs boson's mass to be so much smaller than the corrections to its calculated mass is if there is some underlying theory that forces these corrections to come in pairs that perfectly cancel one another out.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Exotic Physics</h4>

          <p>What happens if there's new particles to be discovered, and new physics theories that describe these particles?  The design of the ATLAS detector isn't optimized for detecting all new particle signatures.  Here are two proton collision events that have been simulated by ATLAS software.  These events contain exotic particles that travel invisibly for some distance before becoming (via decay) the regular particles of the Standard Model.  (Exotic particles simply means new particles that do not belong to the standard model).</p>
